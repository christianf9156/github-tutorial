<p><strong>Github is like a storage container, which saves your code &amp; projects on the cloud(internet)</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Github visiually keeps track of code </li>
<li>Requires git</li>
<li>Easy to work with a team or partner </li>
<li> <strong><em>Super easy to share files with others</em></strong> </li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Git is a version control, which means it manages multiple tasks and files.</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Git does not require Github to work</li>
<li>has a "snap shot method" - takes pictures of code</li>
<li>runs in the terminal</li>
<li><strong><em>has its own commands</em> </strong></li>
<li><strong> <em>every command starts with git, when you initiate git in the terminal</em> </strong></li>
<li>Link git to github using the command (git colne (ssh key to your repository))</li>
<li>you can use git in this terminal at this website after singing up with GITHUBopening your IDE(INTERGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIORNMENT) <a href="https://c9.io">https://c9.io</a>
</li>
<li><strong>NOTE: TO SIGN UP WITH GITHUB; 1ST) MAKE A GITHUB ACCOUNT | 2ND) GO TO c9.io AND AT THE TOP RIGHT WILL BE A CAT SYMBOL. CLICK IT!!!   | 3D) TYPE IN YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT INFO</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Github works with git to share files, projects, repositories and directories</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Github only saves the code that is <strong>PUSHED</strong> from git</li>
<li>Must have an account at <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> in order to use github </li>
<li>On the github website you make your respository to hold and save all code </li>
<li>You can make new repositories in github for different projects and to keep projects organized</li>
<li>can link to git by copying and pasting your ssh key to git with git clone </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>1) You should see <strong>(+New repository)</strong> on the right side of the page after signing in<br>
2) To make a new repository(repo) to save and share projects, codes, files, etc: You have to first make a directory(folder) on the c9 terminal<br>
3)After making the directory on the c9 terminal <em>(mkdir folder name)</em>  go to github.com and sign in<br>
4) When you are signed in you should see the <strong>(+New repository)</strong> button. Click it then name it the exact same name as your directory from <strong>git</strong><br>
5) After naming your repo You will see a few options appear. In the  Quick setup section you will see HTTPS &amp; SSH<br>
6) You can select HTTPS or SSH.  However I recommened SSH because it's more secure, better protected, and impossible to hack without the key code<br>
7)If you selected HTTPS you will have to type in your e-mail and password everytime you want to make changes to your file or code, and it is easy to hack because all a person would need is your e-mail and password!!<br>
8)  To make an e-mail and password type the command ( <strong>git config</strong> ). Then type (<strong>user.e-mail</strong>) then (<strong>user.password</strong>)<br>
9) After selecting SSH. <strong>Copy &amp; Paste</strong> these 2 lines from the section that says <strong>(â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line)</strong>, one line at a time into git in this order: ** git remote add origin <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:(your account)/GitHubTest.git then git push -u origin master**<br>
10) Everything should be set up now so go back to git in the c9.io terminal</p>

<a id="repository-setup" class="anchor" href="#repository-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository Setup</h1>

<p>1) After making your repo with <strong>SSH</strong>, you can now make as much repos as you like<br>
2) To use git in the c9 terminal you have to type this command in once you are in the correct directory:  <strong>git init</strong>
3) Git Init tells the terminal that you want to use git so from now on, all commands will have to use git<br>
3) To save your code onto github.com: you have to type in these 3 commands:  <strong>git add(file name) git commit -m "2 words explaining what you did" git push</strong><br>
4) <strong>git add</strong> - creates a stage around the file so that git can see it<br>
5) <strong>git commit -m "msg goes here"</strong> - allows you to <strong><em>quickly</em></strong> explain what you have done in your code or what a piece of code does<br>
6)<strong>git push</strong> - pushes all of your saves and commits onto your repo in GitHub<br>
7) The repo in your GitHub is your <strong>Local Repo</strong>. This means that it is only on your machine and only you have access to it<br>
8) A <strong>Remote Repo</strong> is an online repo in which other people can view your repo and suggest changes to your ocde to make it better<br>
9) To use this remote repo you have to fork another person's repo then copy their SSH key with git clone<br>
10) Only if you want to see other peoples' projects and make suggestions to improve one's code</p>

</h2>

<p><strong>The git work flow is like:</strong><br>
1) In your terminal you go to the directory that has git initiated<br>
2) The repo allows you to edit files in git<br>
3) Then you save your work (git add)<br>
4) Then add a short msg about what you did (git commit -m)<br>
5) Send your changed and saved work to your repo on github ( git push)  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>git init</strong> - brings you into git<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>git status</strong> - will show you all the files that have been changed and if the file is <strong>red</strong> then it as not been added</li>
<li>
<strong>TIP</strong> : when done typing in code. Type in git status in the command line and your file should appear <strong>RED</strong>, this means you have not put a stage on your file (git add). After doing git add, type in git status again and the file should be green this time. This means it is ready to be committed and pushed  </li>
<li>
<strong>git add</strong> - creates a stage for written code or project, so that it can be tracked(the file name should be green after you git add)<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>git commit -m "msg"</strong> - lets you write a short msg that summerizes the thing you did or changes you have made<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>git config</strong> - allows you to set up your email (user.email) and password (user.password)<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>git push</strong> - pushes all save files and commits onto github<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>git pull</strong> - allows you to save changes from another repo<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>git help</strong> - for more clarification on a certian command</li>
</ul>
