**Github is like a storage container, which saves your code & projects on the cloud(internet)**  

* Github visiually keeps track of code 
* Requires git
* Easy to work with a team or partner 
*  **_Super easy to share files with others_**

## Git vs. GitHub
1. **Git is a version control, which means it manages multiple tasks and files.**  
  * Git does not require Github to work
  * has a "snap shot method" - takes pictures of code
  * runs in the terminal
  * **<span style="color:red">_has its own commands_ </span>**
  * **<span style="color:red"> _every command starts with git, when you initiate git in the terminal_ </span>**
  * Link git to github using the command <span style="color:red">(git colne (ssh key to your repository))</span>
  * you can use git in this terminal at this website after singing up with <span style="color:red">GITHUB</span>opening your IDE(INTERGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIORNMENT) https://c9.io
  * **<span style="color:red">NOTE: TO SIGN UP WITH GITHUB; 1ST) MAKE A GITHUB ACCOUNT | 2ND) GO TO c9.io AND AT THE TOP RIGHT WILL BE A CAT SYMBOL. CLICK IT!!!   | 3D) TYPE IN YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT INFO</span>**
  
 
2. **Github works with git to share files, projects, repositories and directories**  
  * Github only saves the code that is **<span style="color:red">PUSHED</span>** from git
  * Must have an account at https://github.com/ in order to use github 
  * On the github website you make your respository to hold and save all code 
  * You can make new repositories in github for different projects and to keep projects organized
  * can link to git by copying and pasting your ssh key to git with git clone
