## Git vs. GitHub
1. **Git is a version control, which means it manages multiple tasks and files.**  
  * Git does not require Github to work
  * has a "snap shot method" - takes pictures of code
  * runs in the terminal
  * **_has its own commands_**
  * **_every command starts with git, when you initiate git in the terminal_**
 
2. **Github works with git to share files, projects, repositories and directories**  
  *
